Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.6.6
=====================================

* Two bugfixes related to case-sensitivity when comparing sets of NS and SOA records.

* Verification that all our tests still pass when run with Net::DNS version 0.80 and Net::DNS::SEC 0.20 on Perl versions 5.14.4, 5.16.3, 5.18.2, 5.20.1 and 5.21.4. With Perl versions 5.10.1 and 5.12.5, Net::DNS::SEC 0.20 does not pass its own tests (tested on OSX 10.9 and Ubuntu Server 14.04). While there is no reason to assume it will not work for DNSCheck, we are unable to verify that it does.

Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.6.5
=====================================

* Further adaptation to new versions of Net::DNS and Net::DNS::SEC. As of this version, Makefile.PL will complain and refuse to run if it sees a Net::DNS or Net::DNS::SEC version known to be too problematic to use.

* The list of reserved IP address ranges have had two IPv6 ranges that were returned to IANA removed, and 6to4 addresses have been reclassified from reserved to discouraged.

* In some cases DNSCheck will provide more diagnostics when there are multiple problems with adresses for MX records.

* When determining which nameserver names to test, case differences will no longer cause the same server to be tested repeatedly.

Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.6.4
=====================================

* This release is entirely to support the incompatible changes in Net::DNS 0.75 (where we did things wrong) and Net::DNS::SEC 0.18.

Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.6.3
=====================================

* Swedish translations of new messages.

* Debian packaging fixes.

* Raise required version of Net::DNS and Net::DNS::SEC.

* Small bugfix contributed by Anand.

Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.6.2
=====================================

* Several bugfixes.

* Adds test for labels of the form "yy--something" where the first two characters are not "xn".

Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.6.0
=====================================

* Recognizes all DNSKEY algorithms currently registered by IANA.

* Logger can be configured to run a callback in user code when a new message is logged.

* Detects zones using DNSCurve encryption.

* Glue tests much improved.

* Hostname check now detects use of reserved domain names according to RFC 6761.

* The default configuration now uses an ASN lookup service hosted by .SE rather than the one hosted by Team Cymru (the ASN data still comes from Team Cymru, .SE just provides the lookup service).

* ASN check now logs a message if it sees a reserved AS number in use.

* Bugfixes, of course.

* Tested with Perl versions 5.10.1, 5.12.5, 5.14.4, 5.16.3 and 5.18.2.

Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.4.0
=====================================

* Minimum required Perl version is now 5.10.1.

* A couple of new tests:

 - That a minimal referral can fit in a 512-octet packet.
 - The responses come from the same IP address the question was sent to.
 - That NSEC or NSEC3 is used in signed zones.
 - That NSEC3 parameters are sane.
 - That RRSIG durations are sane.

* CZNIC contributed a Czech translation.

* Reserved IP ranges updated according to new RFCs.

* All tests that made SMTP connections have been removed.

* The CLI script has a --level flag to specify the lowest log level you want printed.

* A new, better algorithm to check nameserver AS distribution.

* Plus of course bug and stability fixes.

Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.3.0
=====================================
Notable changes:

* The configuration file layout has changed completely!

  Instead of the old, complicated variant, default configuration, default 
  policy and language files are now installed in the proper place in the Perl 
  module tree. The user should never need to care exactly where that is. Local 
  changes to the configuration now lives in /etc/dnscheck/config.yaml and 
  /etc/dnscheck/policy.yaml

  You have to manually move and rename your old site_config.yaml and 
  site_policy.yaml, if you have them!


Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.2.6
=====================================
Notable changes:

* Fixes one crash bug in v1.2.5

* Completely re-works unit tests, making them more reliable and more 
  comprehensive.


Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.2.4
=====================================
Noteable changes:

* A real fix for issue #52, i.e. reverting the code to v1.2 in Delegation.pm... 


Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.2.3
=====================================
Notable changes:

* Fix for issue #52 in Github, introduced in v1.2.2

* Fix of the "Check for IPv6 NS addresses only at parent or only at child." 



Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.2.2
=====================================
Notable changes:

* Test for NS records pointing at CNAMEs.

* Test for discrepancy in IPv6 presence at parent and child.

* Multiple changes of default policy levels, mostly to do with the growing importance of DNSSEC.

* General fixes for bugs, stability issues and correctness.


Release Notes for DNSCheck Lib v1.2
===================================
Changes since version 1.2:
--------------------------

* Fix an XSS issue in the web GUI.

* Fix a bug in the delegation-testing code.


New features since version 1.1:
-------------------------------

* The dispatcher can now be started as root, and change to a specified user
  and group after it's done with opening files.
  
* The project has moved to Github. It can now be found at http://github.com/dotse/dnscheck


Bugfixes and changes to tests since version 1.1
-----------------------------------------------

* The NO_TCP and NO_UDP tests have been made more reliable.

* Some tests stop earlier if they can't run, avoiding some reports that don't
  make sense (like nameservers that don't respond at all being stated not to
  be recursive).
  
* The concept of "mandatory algorithms" for DNSSEC has been retired. Instead,
  there will be warnings if DNSKEY or DS records are found to be using
  cryptographic algorithms listed as unallocated, reserved or private by IANA.
  
* The DNSSEC tests now deal correctly with SHA-2 keys.
  
* Undelegated tests should work again.

* There are new and changed messages. If you're using the Web GUI, don't
  forget to reload the message table in the database.


Currently known issues
----------------------

* Several DNSSEC tests need improving and/or re-thinking.

* In some instances, the DNSCheck recursive resolver does not get the same
  result as, for example, BIND, due to ours being less forgiving. If we should
  change the current behavior has not been decided.
  
* Zones with nameservers that do not answer queries for DNSSEC-related records
  when the query packet does not have the DNSSEC flag set will get broken
  results from our DNSSEC tests.
  
* There is an outstanding issue where DNSCheck for at least one domain sends
  some queries to the wrong parent zone's servers.
