=head1 NAME

The DNSCheck System

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Introduction

The central part of the DNSCheck system are the Perl modules that perform the
actual tests. All of them should be used by creating a L<DNSCheck.pm> object
and letting it create other objects as needed and/or requested. These modules
will make lots of queries to DNS servers all around the world, and sooner or
later return a result in the form of a list of messages.

At this level, the libs can be used for any number of tasks. In the examples
directory in the source distribution there is, for example, a script that lets
one monitor the status of a domain via the Nagios monitoring system.

The system as distributed, however, contains more than the lib. There are also
a couple of programs and a web interface. We will not talk about the web
interface here, except to mention that it like the rest of the programs
communicate with the other parts via the database tables to be mentioned
later.

=head2 The programs

=head3 The dispatcher

The program that actually runs tests is L<dnscheck-dispatch>. It polls the
table C<queue> table in the database every 0.25 seconds, and forks children to
run tests on what it finds there. It monitors the state of the children, and
cleans up after they exit. If a child exits uncleanly, the test it was running
is re-scheduled. If the same domain causes unclean exits five times or more,
that domain will be blacklisted and will not be tested again until the
dispatcher is restarted.

If the dispatcher receives a TERM signal, it will stop starting new tests,
wait for the ones currently running to exit and then exit in good order. This
may at worst take several minutes.

If the dispatcher receives a HUP signal, it will do an orderly exit as above,
and then re-execute itself. If it was not originally started with a full
pathname, the re-execution may fail.

The dispatcher is written to do a small number of tasks (get queue entry,
start child, clean up after it) in as robust fashion as possible. As of this
writing, the program appears to be very reliable as long as the database
server is not too heavily loaded. Exactly what "too heavily loaded" means in
practice will vary, of course, but as a rule of thumb, if a simple UPDATE
takes more than a second to finish the system is almost certainly there.

It is B<vital> that the queue table use the InnoDB storage engine. If it is
MyISAM, there will be data corruption under heavy load. Other storage engines
with sane transaction handling should also work, but have not been tested. 

At the moment, only MySQL is supported. Patches to add support for more
databases are welcome.

The dispatcher's child processes run the default tests on the given domain,
write the results to the C<tests> and C<results> tables in the database and
then exits.

=head3 The zone change detector

One of the programs that insert entries into the C<queue> table is
L<dnscheck-zonediff>. This program does a zone transfer of a specified domain
and looks at all the C<NS> and C<DS> records. For ever subdomain, it'll
concatenate the textual representations of the records and calculate an MD5
sum of the resulting string. If that sum is not identical with what it was the
previous time the program was run, the subdomain in question will be scheduled
for testing (that is, it'll be written to the C<queue> table, where the
dispatcher will pick it up).

The change detector stores data between runs in a simple text file, with a
zone name and its corresponding MD5 sum on each line.

At the moment, the time it takes to do the AXFR is limited by the speed at
which the Perl module Net::DNS can create new records. It also uses a fair bit
of RAM (100-150MB for around 750 thousand domains), so if you're planning to
run it against C<.com> you'll want a pretty hefty machine.

=head3 The results mailer

The L<dnscheck-12hourmailer> script reads results of tests from the database
tables C<tests> and C<results>, aggregates them per registrar and sends an
email to each registrar with a summary of serious problems found among their
domains.

This is pretty specific to C<.SE>, particularly the bit that maps domain names
to registrars and fetches contact information for the registrars. If you want
to do something similar to this, you'll probably need to modify the code of
the script. At the moment, the emails are also generated entirely
programmatically, so changing their formatting also involves changing code.

=head3 The preflight script

L<dnscheck-preflight> is used by the web GUI. It takes a name as a command
line argument and prints the string TRUE if it's a domain and FALSE otherwise.

=head3 The hostsyntax script

L<dnscheck-hostsyntax> is also used by the web GUI. It takes a name as a
command line argument, and prints the string TRUE if it is a syntactically
valid hostname and FALSE otherwise.

=head3 The CLI interface

L<dnscheck> is a command line tool to check domains. Run it with the switch
C<--help> to get a short description of how to use it.

=head2 The database

It's entirely possible to use the lib part of DNSCheck without a database. All
the surrounding functionality, however, needs one. All communication between
various parts of the entire system is done entirely through database tables.
While this may not be the most convenient interface ever, it does mean that
anything that can talk to MySQL can be a part of the system, which is useful.

There are a number of tables. Let's start looking at them from the top of, so
to speak, the food chain.

=head3 The source table

Anythingt that can write to the C<queue> table can be a source of domains to
be tested. In order to make it possible to keep track of which source
requested which test, there is the C<source> table. It has only three fields,
and is supposed to be mostly read-only. The fields are C<id>, C<name> and
C<contact>. The id is an autoincrementing integer as usual. The name is a
human-readable name for the source. The contact is some sort of human-useable
contact information for the source in question (email address, phone number,
ham radio call sign,...).

One example of the use of source information is the mailer described above,
which only mails results about tests that were scheduled for testing by the
zone change detector, not once that came from (for example) the web GUI.
    
=head3 The queue table

This table has six fields apart from the autoincrementing C<id>. There is
C<domain>, which is the name of a domain to be tested. There is C<priority>,
which is an integer. L<dnscheck-dispatch> will always pick the queue entry
with the highest priority first (and if there are several with the same
priority, the one with the lowest id). There is C<inprogress>, which is NULL
to begin with and gets a timestamp written to it by the dispatcher when it's
been scheduled for testing. There is a C<tester_pid> field, where the
particular child process that's running the test for the domain writes it's
system PID (if we ever need to have more than one machince running tests, thre
maybe a host field added here). C<source_id> pints into the source table.
C<source_data> is any data specific to this test that is relevant for the
specific source. The two source fields are simply copied over to the C<tests>
table when a test is started.

=head3 The tests table

This table has one row for every test run, an contains information on the
domain tested, the start and finish times of the test, a summary of the
results and the source information that was copied from the queue table. The
fields are: C<id> as usual, C<domain> for the domain name, C<begin> for the
start time (with whole-second resolution), C<end> for the finish time,
C<count_critical>, C<count_error>, C<count_warning>, C<count_notice> and
C<count_info> for the number of problems at the respecive severity levels,
C<source_id> to point into the source table and finally C<source_data> to hold
whatever data that source wants.

=head3 The results table

This table has a number of rows for every test. They reflect the list of
results returned after a test is run, and several of the fields are rather
specific to the web GUI application. The fields that can be useful to others
are: C<test_id>, which points into the C<tests> table. C<timestamp> with is
the time at which the log entry was entered (with microsecond resolution).
C<level> which is one of the all-caps strings CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE
or INFO. C<message> which is the message tag that describes the reason the log
entry was made. C<arg0> to C<arg9>, which are arguments to the message.

The message tags are specified in YAML files.

=head3 The messages table 

The messages table contains a copy of a localy YAML file. It is used by the
web GUI.

=head3 The delegation_history table

This table contains information about which nameservers has historically been
authoritative for domains. Some tests use it, if it's available.

=head3 The nameservers and nsp tables

The function of these tables have been obsoleted by the registrar system.

=head3 The domains table

A list of domains. More of a convenience thing than an actual part of the
DNSCheck system.

=head3 Needed permissions

The various programs need different sets of permissions in the database in
order to work correctly. It breaks down as follows:

=over 4

=item *

Everything that schedules tests needs INSERT, UPDATE and SELECT on C<sources>
and INSERT on C<queue>.

=item *

Everything that reads test results needs SELECT on C<sources>, C<tests> and
C<results>.

=item *

Anything that runs tests needs SELECT on C<delegation_history> (or no database
access at all).

=item *

L<dnscheck-dispatcher> needs a lot: INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE on
C<queue>, INSERT, SELECT and UPDATE on C<tests>, INSERT on C<results> plus
everything listed above.

=back

In practice, the easiest reasonably secure setup is to give the web GUI one
user with very limited permissions (INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT on C<sources> and
INSERT on C<queue>), and one user with full rights on all tables for the rest
of the system. Indeed, since all of the programs use the database connection
info given in the L<config.yaml> file, you will need to point out a
different such file to any programs you want to use different connection
information.

=head2 Files

The system uses a number of files.

=head3 /etc/dnscheck/config.yaml

This contains configuration information in YAML format. It overrides what is in 
the default configuration, and is where local changes (such as database access 
information and TSIG keys) should be entered.

One key that is usually not in the configuration but that can be added if
needed is the "disable" key. It has two levels under it, being the name a test
module (converted to lowercase) and the name of a method in that module. If
the value for the method is true, that method will not be run. Note that no
kind of sanity checking is done, and that some tests rely on each other, so
disabling one may make others give false results. Be cautious and know what
you're doing. As an example, the following would disable all DNSSEC tests:

  disable:
      dnssec:
         test: 1
       
All test methods mentioned in the documentation for the respective modules are
possible to disable this way.

=head4 Filter rules

It is also possible to set log message filters in the config file (see
L<DNSCheck::Logger> for more about filters). The format for this is a hash of
lists of hashes, all under the top-level key C<filters>, so the syntax gets a
bit convoluted. Here is an example:

    filters:
      'NAMESERVER:NOT_AUTH':
        - args:
            - 'ns.ripe.net'
            - '193.0.9.6'
          level: 'WARNING'
      'DNS:SOA_SERVFAIL':
        - args:
            - '193.0.9.6'
          level: 'NOTICE'
        - args:
            - '2001:67c:e0:0:0:0:0:6'
          level: 'WARNING'

Under the "filters" key, there is a hash. The keys of this hash are DNSCheck message tags. In the example, C<NAMESERVER:NOT_AUTH> and
C<DNS:SOA_SERVFAIL>. Under those keys are lists of rules. Each rule consists of a hash with two keys, C<args> and C<level>. Args holds a list of
values, all of which must be string-wise equal to the arguments of the incoming message for the rule to apply. Level must be one of the strings
C<CRITICAL>, C<ERROR>, C<WARNING>, C<NOTICE>, C<INFO> or C<DEBUG>.

So the example above has three rules:

=over

=item 1

Any message with the tag C<NAMESERVER:NOT_AUTH> where the first two arguments are C<ns.ripe.net> and C<193.0.9.6> has its level set to C<WARNING>.

=item 2

Any message with the tag C<DNS:SOA_SERVFAIL> where the first argument is C<193.0.9.6> has its level set to C<NOTICE>.

=item 3

Any message with the tag C<DNS:SOA_SERVFAIL> where the first argument is C<2001:67c:e0:0:0:0:0:6> has its level set to C<WARNING>.

=back

The easiest way to see what the actual arguments are is to run a test using the command line tool L<dnscheck> with the C<--raw> flag. With that
flag, for each message the tag will be printed inside square brackets and all arguments are printed after it separated by semi-colons.

=head3 policy.yaml

C<policy.yaml> specifies the severity of various problems. The default values
represent .SE's view on best practices for DNS. If you want to change
anything, do so in C</etc/dnscheck/policy.yaml>.
